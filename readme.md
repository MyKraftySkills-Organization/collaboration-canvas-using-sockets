# Collaborative Canvas using Socket.io

For starters I picked a code from socket.io example here:
1. [Whiteboard example](https://socket.io/demos/whiteboard/)

For contribution guidelines read CONTRIBUTING.md file


Latest Updates:
1. Static color pallete is switched with dynamic color picker
2. Clear Icon is added, which will clear the canvas.
3. Todo: Clear is working only on local canvas and on all instance of canvas.
